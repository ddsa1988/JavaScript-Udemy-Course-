/*
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')

2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)

3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)

4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.

Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
